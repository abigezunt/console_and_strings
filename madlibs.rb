LET us #{verb3} then, you and I,\n	
When the #{noun1} is spread out against the sky	\n

Let us go, through certain half-#{adj1} streets,	\n
The #{gerund1} retreats	       \n
Of #{adj2} nights in one-night cheap hotels	\n
And sawdust #{place} with #{animal}-shells:	\n
Streets that #{verb} like a #{adj3} argument	\n
Of insidious intent	\n
To #{verb2} you to an overwhelming questionâ€¦	        \n
#{oh}, do not ask, 'What is it?'	\n
Let us #{verb3} and make our visit.	\n\n

To #{prepare} a face to meet the faces that you meet;\n

That #{lift} and #{drop} a question on your #{plate};	\n        
Time for you and time for me,	\n
And time yet for #{hundred} indecisions,	\n

Before the taking of a #{toast} and tea.\n	\n
